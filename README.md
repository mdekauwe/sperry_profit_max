# Sperry profit maximisation

This is a very simple version of the Sperry optimisation model using code from Wang et al. with the addition of time varying met data a simple soil water bucket. The code is as in Wang et al., with added units and assumes a whole
plant vulnerability, i.e. not split into leaves, stem, etc.
